## 🔥 Why "Anthropomorphic"?

This repository is the open-source home for my published technical articles and hands-on labs—currently focused on AWS, Terraform, and Kubernetes, with new technologies added as I explore them.

The name *Anthropomorphic* reflects my belief that **technology should serve human understanding**: complex systems made clear, automation made intuitive, and knowledge made shareable.  

Every script, guide, and diagram here is crafted to empower engineers—not just to deploy, but to *comprehend*.
