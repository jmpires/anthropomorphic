# Anthropomorphic ᛉ

In Greek, *anthropomorphic* comes from the words **“anthropos”** (**ἄνθρωπος**), meaning *“human,”* and **“morphe”** (**μορφή**), meaning *“form”* or *“shape.”*

This repository embodies that idea in the world of infrastructure: **technology shaped by human reasoning—not obscured by it.**

Here, you'll find:
- 📖 **Learning Logs** – Notes, documentation, and insights gained along the way.  
- 💡 **Projects** – Personal and open-source experiments in cloud, automation, and intelligent systems.

And always: **explanations, not just commands.**  
Every line of code is crafted to empower engineers to **comprehend**, not just deploy.

This is more than a portfolio ... it’s a philosophy in practice.

## 🔥 Why "Anthropomorphic"?

This repository is the open-source home for my published technical articles and hands-on labs—currently focused on AWS, Terraform, and Kubernetes, with new technologies added as I explore them.

The name *Anthropomorphic* reflects my belief that **technology should serve human understanding**: complex systems made clear, automation made intuitive, and knowledge made shareable.  

Every script, guide, and diagram here is crafted to empower engineers—not just to deploy, but to *comprehend*.
